# **Uncovering the Drivers Behind Rising Hotel Cancellation Rates: Data Analysis Project**

## **(1) Project Roadmap:**

1. **Define Problem Statement:** Address the issue of increasing cancellation orders in hotels.
2. **Data Identification:** Select the dataset `hotels.csv` for analysis.
3. **Data Preparation:** Clean and explore the data using Python to ensure quality and consistency.
4. **Data Analysis:** Extract insights to identify reasons behind the rise in hotel cancellation orders.


## **(2) Introduction:**
This project aims to identify the key factors contributing to the **increasing rate of hotel booking cancellations**. We will explore primary reasons, such as **high average daily rates**, and secondary factors, including **discrepancies between online hotel photos and actual conditions**. Utilizing the **Python** programming language, we will begin with **data cleaning, manipulation, and normalization using the Pandas library to handle outliers and null values**. Following this, we will employ **data visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to create insightful plots**. Through detailed analysis of these visualizations, we will uncover the underlying reasons for the surge in hotel cancellation orders.

## **(3) Tools I Used:**
1. **Kaggle**: Source of the hotels dataset.
2. **Python Programming Language**: Used for overall data manipulation and analysis.
3. **Pandas Library**: Utilized for data cleaning, manipulation, standardization (normalization), and handling outliers and null values.
4. **Matplotlib**: Employed for data visualization.
5. **Seaborn**: Used for statistical data visualization.
6. **Git & GitHub**: for sharing my analysis and insights.
